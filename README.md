**📊 Data Analytics Project — End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard**
**🧩 Overview**
This project demonstrates a complete Data Analytics workflow — from data loading and cleaning to visualization and reporting.
It showcases practical skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and data storytelling.
The main goal is to extract insights from raw data, visualize key findings, and present results through an interactive dashboard and presentation.

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**
Programming	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)	Data cleaning, transformation, and EDA
Database	MySQL	Querying and analyzing structured data
Visualization	Power BI	Building interactive dashboards
Reporting	Gamma App	Creating presentation reports
Environment	Jupyter Notebook / VS Code	Development and analysis

**🔍 Steps Followed**
**1. Data Loading & Exploration (Python)**
Imported dataset using Pandas.
Checked data types, missing values, and statistical summary.
Visualized basic trends and distributions.
**2. Data Cleaning**
Handled missing and duplicate records.
Standardized column names and formats.
Removed outliers and corrected inconsistencies.
Exported the cleaned dataset for SQL and Power BI use.
**3. SQL Analysis (MySQL)**
Created a database and imported the cleaned dataset.
Ran SELECT, GROUP BY, and JOIN queries to extract key metrics.
Derived insights like total revenue, top categories, and customer trends.
**4. Visualization (Power BI)**
Connected Power BI to MySQL.
Built interactive dashboards with KPIs, charts, and filters.
Highlighted major insights and trends visually.
**5. Reporting (Gamma Presentation)**
Summarized findings and visual results into a clear, concise presentation.
Included insights, recommendations, and key business takeaways.

**📈 Dashboards**
The Power BI dashboard includes:
Overall KPIs (e.g., total revenue, average order value)
Category-wise and region-wise analysis
Time-series trends
Top-performing segments and insights
